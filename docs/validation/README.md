# Validation

Independent evidence that each analysis tool is correct and follows the GIS
definition it claims, or a statement of where and why it differs. One page per
area: the definitions, reference tools and versions, cases, tolerances,
results and a verdict per tool.

## Terrain shape and archaeological visualisation

[terrain.md](terrain.md): slope, slope (percent), aspect (grid and true north),
profile, plan (tangential) and mean curvature, rugosity, TPI, TRI, local
relief model, sky-view factor and positive and negative openness, live and
fast (bake), against closed forms, GDAL 3.12.0, WhiteboxTools 2.4.0 and
rvt-py 2.2.1. All agree; plan-curvature naming, TPI sampling and the horizon
search region are documented convention differences. No bugs found. Resolved:
the plan curvature preset is labelled Plan (Tangential) Curvature and the TPI
default is 96 samples.
